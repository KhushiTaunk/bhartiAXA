          Life insurance offers three major benefits.

          PROTECTION
          </Typography>
          <Typography gutterBottom>
          Life is full of uncertainties; investing in a life insurance plan provides a safety net. Your insurance provider is liable to pay your beneficiary or nominee the pre-determined death benefit, thus keeping your family protected even in your absence.

          LONG TERM SAVING
          </Typography>
          <Typography gutterBottom>
          It is important to consider life insurance if you are seeking to make long-term savings. The suitable product helps you to save systematically and build a corpus for your future; its accumulated amount may be used for your life goals. Whatâ€™s more, life insurance plans also offer regular pay-outs in the form of annuities, and are therefore, an excellent tool to finance your retirement goals.

          INVESTMENT
          </Typography>
          <Typography gutterBottom>
          Unit-Linked Investment Plans (ULIPs) offered by life insurance providers are primarily investment instruments. These market-linked products create wealth. ULIPs offer significant returns on premiums paid towards the insurance policy. Most plans provide considerable returns during maturity, thus making them an attractive investment vehicle.

          <Typography gutterBottom>         
          Besides this, life insurance plans offer a host of other benefits, like tax deductions under Section 10, 80C, and 80CCC of the Income Tax Act, 1961 on the premium paid. You may also borrow a loan against your insurance plan if needed.

          Life insurance plans provide financial support to you and your family. Buying an insurance policy also inculcates the habit of disciplined savings.
